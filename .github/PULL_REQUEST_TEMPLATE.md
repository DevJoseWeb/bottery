Hi! Thank you for contributing to **Bottery**! Make sure you have followed our
[Contributing guideline](https://docs.bottery.io/en/latest/contributing.html)
at the docs. Here is some reminders:

- Tests and documentation **are not** optional. Make sure you documented and
tested the changes you are proposing;
- Every pull request must refer to an issue. Explain the problem you're solving
there, here is how you are fixing it;
- Briefly describe the changes at the **Bottery Nightly** section on *CHANGELOG.md*;
- The bigger the Pull Request, the harder it is to review it. Break your
solution into small pieces of code;
